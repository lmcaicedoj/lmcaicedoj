# Hi I'm Luis Miguel Caicedo 

## 🚀 About Me
I am a Data Engineer and Analytics professional with a strong track record in designing, building, and scaling data pipelines that support both operational and strategic decision-making in complex enterprise environments. With experience leading multi-system integrations, cloud-native architectures, and high-governance data workflows, I focus on transforming fragmented, legacy data ecosystems into reliable, observable, and high-quality data products.

Beyond my enterprise work, I’m academically driven. I hold an MSc in Data Science & Analytics and have participated in research and educational initiatives worldwide—including collaborations on biogas energy modeling and teaching roles in China. I am also developing Bio-Tesseract, a venture that blends analytics, sustainability, and education.

I bring a global mindset, a strong sense of curiosity, and a reputation for being dependable, thorough, and solution-oriented. With interests in cloud engineering, pipeline orchestration, data quality, and sustainable technology, I continue to grow as a data engineer prepared to take on high-impact, multi-country data challenges.
